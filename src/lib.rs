//! The Leptos UI on the main thread.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! The engine runs in a web worker on an `OffscreenCanvas`. The worker seam
//! (canvas transfer, input forwarding, picking, stats) is
//! `nightshade_leptos` on this side and `nightshade_api::offscreen` on the
//! worker side, so this crate is only the page: the game state, the HUD, and
//! the game messages.
//!
//! - `src/app.rs` creates the engine handle and composes the components.
//! - `src/state.rs` is the game-specific page state, grouped as `Copy` signals.
//! - `src/components/` holds the components: the example HUD.
//!
//! Add a new feature by extending the `protocol` enums, sending them with
//! `engine.send` (page side), handling them in `apply_custom`
//! (`worker/src/systems/example.rs`), and building the UI in a new file under
//! `src/components/`.
